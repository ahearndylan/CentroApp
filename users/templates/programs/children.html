        <h4 class="card-title">Youth Support Program</h4>
        <p class="card-description">Youth Support Program provides culturally sensitive case-management to the Department of Children and Families (DCF) involved adolescents and their families that require intensive support services.</p>
        <p class="card-description">Program components include academic support, life skills training, parent/adolescent mediation, community service connection, and emergency support.</p>
        <p class="card-description">The goal of this program is to promote the well-being of adolescents/pre-adolescents between the ages of 10 through 17 and their families by providing appropriate culturally and linguistic supportive services, building on the existing strengths of the family, and empowering families to make their own decisions in an effort to reduce or eliminate child abuse and neglect. Visits to the youth are weekly.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Intensive Family Stabilization (IFS)</h4>
        <p class="card-description">Intensive Family Stabilization (IFS) provides culturally sensitive intensive intervention, through clinical and case-management services utilizing a team-approach by a Masters-level clinician and a BA/BS-level or equivalent caseworker.</p>
        <p class="card-description">These cases are typically short-term in nature, and given the significant level of challenges faced by the families involved, they are intensive.</p>    
        <p class="card-description">The approach requires a clinical assessment of needs and strategies identified by DCF, the family, and clinical staff with clinical intervention by the clinician and case management by the Family Support Worker through community service connection, parenting skill-building, parent/child mediation, and life skills training. Visits to the family are one visit by each staff member weekly.</p>

        <p class="card-description">Parent Support Services (PSS) provides culturally sensitive case-management to the Department of Children and Families (DCF) involved parents that require intensive support services.</p>
        <p class="card-description">Program components include academic support, life skills training, parent/adolescent mediation, community service connection, and emergency support.</p>
        <p class="card-description">The goal of this program is to promote the well-being of children between the ages of 0 through 17 and their families by providing appropriate culturally and linguistic supportive services, building on the existing strengths of the family, and empowering families to make their own decisions in an effort to reduce or eliminate child abuse and neglect. We also implement the Nurturing Parenting Curriculum in cases where this intervention is necessary. Visits to the parent and family are weekly.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Comprehensive Foster Care (CFC)</h4>
        <p class="card-description">Centro's Comprehensive Family Care (CFC)  Program seeks to place special needs foster children with treatment foster homes that offer a safe, nurturing, and compassionate environment. Service delivery occurs through the training and supervision of all foster families.</p>
        <p class="card-description">These families are supported with access to education, case management, clinical services, and community resources. The placement will ensure a safe environment inclusive of culture, beliefs, values, language, and religion.</p>    
        <p class="card-description">This fostering the goal of achieving permanency, bringing our children home to be nurtured and loved.</p>
        <p class="card-description">Centro's CFC Program's mission meets its goal of permanency by providing individuals and families with culturally and linguistically competent services. This includes, but is not limited to, supporting social, educational, behavioral health, and health-related care.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Outreach & Tracking</h4>
        <p class="card-description">Outreach & Tracking is similar to Youth Support in provision of culturally sensitive case-management to Department of Children and Families (DCF) involved adolescents and their families that require intensive support services.</p>
        <p class="card-description">Program components include: academic support, life skills training, parent/adolescent mediation, community service connection, and emergency support.</p>
        <p class="card-description">The goal of this program is to promote the well-being of adolescents/pre-adolescents between the ages of 10 through 17 and their families by providing appropriate culturally and linguistic supportive services, building on the existing strengths of the family, and empowering families to make their own decisions in an effort to reduce or eliminate child abuse and neglect.</p>
        <p class="card-description">These youth tend to be at higher risk, including court involvement and/or not keeping whereabouts known to their parents, and engaging in dangerous behaviors. Therefore, in addition to intensive support provided to adolescents experiencing a challenging transition period to young adulthood, this program has a 24 hour component.</p>
        <p class="card-description">There is also a tracking component of the service which allows the parent(s)/guardian(s) to contact the assigned staff to assist in locating the youth. Visits to the youth and family are twice weekly.</p>
        <p class="card-description">Funded by a contract with the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF), CENTROâ€™s Outreach & Tracking service is modeled after the program operated by the Key Program, Inc., which, in addition to intensive support provided to adolescents experiencing a challenging transition period to young-adulthood, this program has a 24 hour component.</p>
