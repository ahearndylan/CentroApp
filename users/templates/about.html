            <h4 class="card-title">OUR PLEDGE</h4>
            <p>
                We achieve our mission by providing culturally and linguistically competent case management, 
                community-based, social, behavioral, mental health, and health-related services; while 
                preserving and sharing our diverse cultural values and experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is possible by establishing a strong bond with our clients and the communities we serve and 
                leveraging partnerships and collaborations with other providers, colleges, universities, hospitals, 
                government entities, and other institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our employees are committed to their clients first, then, their colleagues, and finally our institution.

                <p>
                    CENTRO has undergone a tremendous transformation during the past 10 years, and it is no longer 
                    the neighborhood center that many Latino families grew up knowing. Thankfully, we are much 
                    more able to meet many of the social, behavioral, and health-related needs of our community 
                    than ever before. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally founded in 1977 as Centro Communal Hispano by a group of community activists to 
                    serve Puerto Ricans, CENTRO was founded by volunteers. Its original purpose was that of 
                    preserving and sharing the Puerto Rican culture, to act as a gathering venue for celebrations 
                    and important community matters, as well as to assist these newcomers establish strong roots 
                    in Worcester. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    CENTRO’s mission and the community it serves has evolved, as the make-up of the population in 
                    Worcester has changed. By the mid-1990s, CENTRO realized that all Latinos in the area could 
                    benefit from the services it offered. That mission has evolved further as the make-up of 
                    Worcester’s population has continued to evolve. Today, we proudly serve individuals and families 
                    from North, Central, and South America. We also serve people from several countries in the African 
                    Continent, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.

                <h4 class="section-heading">OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS:</h4>
                <p>
                    CENTRO’s vision 2020 strategic planning process has been conceived and we are going into year two of implementation. 
                    During the last six months of FY 2019, CENTRO concluded the process, and produced its first critically important three-year plan. 
                    In order to do so, the organization’s leadership was able to actively engage 52 different stakeholders from our community to participate in this process. 
                    Board Members, Payees, Leadership Staff, Employees, Clients, and other community representatives contributed. 
                    In addition, we elicited feedback, recommendations and suggestions, from over 150 clients and front-line employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of developing our strategic plan, we elicited CENTRO Client input, by way of a survey to 500 of our clients; 
                    We gathered CENTRO Employee feedback at our Employee retreat, as well as at a special activity in September 2018; 
                    and we had a graduate Capstone Group from Clark University conduct a Strategic Analysis. In October 2018, 
                    we held a kick-off event, with all 52 stake-holders; during which we had one expert of each of CENTRO’s three divisions, 
                    speak on the condition of the industry, the future of each of those and what roll CENTRO could play, if it prepared adequately.
                </p>

                    <li>CENTRO Family Services</li>

                    <li>New Americans Community Development Corporation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We separated these stakeholders into three subcommittees, reflecting those three divisions. Through the winter 
                    we held 9 different subcommittee meetings, during which we elicited feedback, strategized and compiled information 
                    to create our Strategic Plan. All the information, feedback and strategies were condensed into five major Benchmarks 
                    to focus on for the next three years; and they are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        CENTRO will focus the necessary resources, attention and time to augment every element that strengthens its workforce.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CENTRO will enhance its clinical capacity and raise the bar on quality of care of persons served.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CENTRO will expand its cultural and Linguistic competence and reach an unequaled level of capacity among its peers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CENTRO will expand its infrastructure and support capacity to ensure it can provide the expected level of excellence in the care of persons served.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CENTRO will ensure its long-term financial strength and sustainability, by implementing even stricter budgeting and financial management practices, aggressive outreach, and enhanced capital development practices.

                    In response to the changing needs of CENTRO’s target population, the organization has evolved into a tri-divisional, 
                    multi-cultural, multi-lingual, fully integrated, health and human services delivery system. This fast-growing, 
                    minority-led organization is the only minority provider of multiple services, under contract to the Commonwealth of MA in Central MA. 
                    CENTRO currently serves over 8,700 individual families in over 52 cities and towns in MA and provided over 24,000 incidents of 
                    client contact services last year. This is year 2 of implementation of its CENTRO Vision 2020, Strategic Planning Process.
